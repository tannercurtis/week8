# Homework 8 - Startup Matchmaker Responsive

Create a responsive website.

### Step 1 - Fork this repository.

From the assignment homepage (https://github.com/fewd05082017/week8), click the "Fork" link on the top right. This will create a copy of the assignment in YOUR github account.

### Step 2 - Clone your forked repository.

From the repository homepage (which will be http://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/week8), click on green "Clone or Download" button and "Open in Desktop". This should open your Github Desktop App and prompt you to save the week8 folder on your computer.

### Step 3 - Build!

Make the fixed-with version of Startup Matchcode a fully responsive website. Use fluid widths, add media queries and em's or rem's where you see fit. You should have, minimally, two media queries (one for large screens and one for mobile screens) and should handle mobile navigation in some way. 

**Be creative!** "Bonus points" for: added features, additional styles, additional pages. 
### Step 4 - Commit and Sync

Work on your website locally and view it in the browser by opening your index.html file. When your site looks good, Commit and Sync with the Github App.

### Step 5 - Pull Request

Send a Pull Request to submit your homework. From your week8 page on github.com (https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/week8), click on the "New Pull Request" button and follow the prompts. 

### Step 6 - Publish with [Gitbot](http://gitbot.co/)! (optional)

Want to post your week8 project on your github.io url? Log into gitbot and click the week8 repository button and VOILA! It will (perhaps after a few minutes) be viewable online at http://YOURUSERNAME.github.io/week8
